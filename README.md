## Key features:
* Six types of auctions

```

Install test suit 4 and ton client:
```shell
pip install -r test/ts4/requirements.txt

```

## Deployment

```shell

## Types of auctions

### English Forward
Most common type of auction. There are start value and step value.
Every bid must be greater than previous on this step value (or more).
The winner is a person with the highest bid.
Every bid must be confirmed by real crystals in a message.
When somebody makes a bid more than your bid, you will get back your crystals values for the previous bid.

In root use method `deployEnglishForwardAuction` or `deployEnglishForwardAuctionCustom` to create auction.
Use method `makeBid` in auction to submit a bid

```solidity
// Root
function deployEnglishForwardAuction(uint128 startValue, uint128 stepValue, uint32 startTime, uint32 openDuration);
function deployEnglishForwardAuctionCustom(address owner, uint128 fee, uint128 startValue, uint128 stepValue, uint32 startTime, uint32 openDuration);
// Auction
function makeBid(uint128 value);
```

</details>

### English Reverse

There are start value and step value. 
Every bid must be lower than previous on this step value (or more).
Winner is a person with the lowest bid.
Bids must not be confirmed by real crystals.

In root use method `deployEnglishReverseAuction` or `deployEnglishReverseAuctionCustom` to create auction.
Use method `makeBid` in auction to submit a bid

function deployEnglishReverseAuctionCustom(address owner, uint128 fee, uint128 startValue, uint128 stepValue, uint32 startTime, uint32 openDuration);
// Auction
function makeBid(uint128 value);
```

</details>

### Dutch Forward

You must set start and finish values in a constructor.
Bid price decreases from bigger (start) to smaller (finish) value.
You can get this life-time price via `getCurrentPrice` method.
More time passes - the lower price you need to bid.
Every bid must be confirmed by real crystals in a message.
Winner is a first person who make a bid.

In root use method `deployDutchForwardAuction` or `deployDutchForwardAuctionCustom` to create auction.
Use method `buy` in auction to submit a bid (and make a buy)

// Auction
function buy(uint128 value);
```

### Blind Forward

Firstly you must make your bid in OPEN phase.
To do this, you must generate random salt, locally encode your bid via `calcBidHash` method and then send this hash.
After then, you must wait for CONFIRMATION phase and confirm your bid.
In this step you must send your salt, bid value and crystals.
This algorithm guarantees that nobody will see your bid in OPEN phase.
In CONFIRMATION phase nobody can do a new bid.
You can remove your bid in OPEN phase.
Winner is a person with the highest bid.

**Important:** there is a deposit value that you should to submit when you make a bid.
This deposit will be returned after confirmation.
It is used to prevent spamming, when someone creates a lot of blind bids but don't confirm they.

In root use method `deployBlindForwardAuction` or `deployBlindForwardAuctionCustom` to create auction.
Use method `makeBid`, `removeBid` and `confirmBid` in auction

```solidity
// Root

function deployBlindForwardAuctionCustom(address owner, uint128 fee, uint128 deposit, uint32 startTime, uint32 openDuration, uint32 confirmationDuration);
// Auction
function makeBid(uint256 hash);
function removeBid(uint256 hash);
function confirmBid(uint128 value, uint256 salt);
function calcBidHash(uint128 value, uint256 salt);  // call off-chain for secure
```

## Tests

To run tests use:
```shell
make tests
```

After updates in tests, run `errors_generator.py` to update python error's class

Test is written on python using `unittest` and `tonos-ts4` libraries.
There are tests for each type of auction (name of files in equals to auction type), and separate tests for root in `root.py`.
Moreover, there is an integration test for all workflow in `workflow.py`.
Test classes inheritance structure is the same as in auction

## Viewer

Viewer listen for events and display all auctions from root in one table.
You can click on any auction to see more info

## Debot

**! Important !** You must call "Set Multisig‚Äù before deploying any type of auction

## TIP3

In branch `tip3` there is a demo of a TIP3 English Forward Auction.
It contains `ts4` tests.
Another auctions will be done in such way.
Used broxus TIP3 implementation (see realization [here](https://github.com/broxus/ton-eth-bridge-token-contracts/tree/master/free-ton/contracts) - 
RootTokenContract.sol and TONTokenWallet.sol contacts)
